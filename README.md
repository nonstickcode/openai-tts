# openai-tts

## Overview

openai-tts is a straightforward, proof-of-concept terminal application created using Node.js. Its primary function is to explore and test the capabilities of OpenAI's new Text-to-Speech (TTS) API. This project serves as the foundational step towards integrating TTS features into larger applications, such as the Chad Bot app project.

## Features

- **Basic TTS Conversion**: Allows users to input text and receive audio output, showcasing the basic functionality of OpenAI's TTS API.
- **Node Terminal Application**: Simple and easy-to-use terminal-based application, making it accessible for quick tests and demonstrations.
- **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrates the potential and ease of integrating OpenAI's TTS API into larger projects.

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Clone the repository and install dependencies via npm.
2. **Run the App**: Execute the app in the terminal and follow prompts to input text.
3. **Receive Audio**: Listen to the TTS conversion and verify the API's functionality.

## Future Scope

- This project is a stepping stone for more complex implementations in future applications.
- Feedback and insights gained from this app will guide the integration of TTS features in the Chad Bot app.

Thank you for exploring openai-tts. This project illuminates the path forward for incorporating advanced TTS capabilities in application development.
